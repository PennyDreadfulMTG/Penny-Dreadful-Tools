## Development Environment Setup

### Docker Compose

- Install Docker (https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- git clone <https://github.com/PennyDreadfulMTG/Penny-Dreadful-Tools.git>
- cd Penny-Dreadful-Tools
- cp .env.example .env
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up

The first run will download a copy of the prod decksite db and set it up as well as build cards db from scryfall data so it will take a while. Set PDM_DOWNLOAD_DEVDB in .env to something other than "true" to skip. The download has been known to fail. You can download it from <https://pennydreadfulmagic.com/static/dev-db.sql.gz> and restore it after gunzipping with something like:

-  mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u pennydreadful -p --ssl=0  decksite <~/path/to/dev-db.sql

The database password can be found in your .env file.

After this, various components will be available in your browser:

- The decksite (PDM) at <http://127.0.0.1:80> (to be able to login see [Configuring Environment](#configuring-environment))
- The admin panel at <http://127.0.0.1:8080>
- The logsite at <http://127.0.0.1:5001>

The database will be running on port 3306 with username 'pennydreadful' and the password from the .env file.

You can run any of the comamnds in dev.py via
```
docker-compose exec decksite pipenv run python3 dev.py name-of-task
```

## Configuring Environment

- Add a new application at <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me>
- Go to the OAuth2 section in your application
- Reset the client secret
- In the root folder of the project copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- In `.env` set `oauth2_client_id` and `oauth2_client_secret` to the client id and client secret found in the OAuth2 section
- Still under the OAuth2 section, add a redirect with the following URI `http://127.0.0.1/authenticate/callback/`
- Go to the Bot section of your application
- Reset the token, use it to fill out `token` in `.env`
- Optionally, add the bot to your server with `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your client id here>&scope=bot`
- Optionally, take a look at shared/configuration.py and enter any required non-default information into `.env`
- You will want to investigate the various targets in dev.py that acts as a Makefile. Some of these utilities use GitHub's commandline git-enchancer, hub: <https://github.com/github/hub>

## Manual Development Environment Setup (Non-docker instructions)

- Install MariaDB 10.0+
- Install python 3.10
- Install pipenv
- Install npm
- Install git
- Install git-lfs
- git clone <https://github.com/PennyDreadfulMTG/Penny-Dreadful-Tools.git>
- cd Penny-Dreadful-Tools
- pipenv install
- pipenv run python build.py
- Using the values from your `.env` issue the following commands in MySQL (you don't need to create the databases):
  - CREATE USER '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>' IDENTIFIED BY '<mysql_passwd>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <decksite_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
    GRANT ALL ON <decksite_test_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <prices_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <magic_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <logsite_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
- Download a copy of the production decksite database (with personal information stripped):
  - mysql -u <mysql_user> -p<mysql_passwd> -e "CREATE DATABASE <decksite_database>"
  - curl <https://pennydreadfulmagic.com/static/dev-db.sql.gz> >/tmp/dev-db.sql.gz
  - gunzip /tmp/dev-db.sql.gz
  - mysql -u <mysql_user> -p<mysql_passwd> <decksite_database> </tmp/dev-db.sql
  - mysql -u <mysql_user> -p<mysql_passwd> -e "CREATE DATABASE <decksite_test_database>"
- Some very minor parts of the bot (the "modofail" command) use libopus and ffmpeg which are not in pip and must be installed in a your-OS-specific way separately. Very optional.

## Running Decksite (pennydreadfulmagic.com)

- pipenv run python run.py decksite
- Visit <http://localhost:5000/>

## Running Logsite (logs.pennydreadfulmagic.com)

- pipenv run python run.py logsite
- Visit <http://localhost:5001/>

## Running Discordbot

- pipenv run python run.py discordbot
- Visit your Discord server.

## Running the tests

There are various levels of granularity but in general use you want:

- pipenv run python dev.py test # Runs the unit tests, type checking, lint.

Check the dev.py source code for the full set of options including `unit`, `types`, `lint` (covered by `test` above) as well as `functional` (integration tests), `perf` (performance tests). `release` will take you all the way from your committed change to a PR via the tests (needs GitHub's commandline `gh` installed).

## Working on React components

- Run logsite
- pipenv run python dev.py watch # Builds bundle.js after every file change. Uses development build so that you get source maps - useful line numbers and error messages, unlike build/buildjs.

## Decksite performance testing/monitoring

- You can run decksite in profiling mode with:
    - $ pipenv run python3 ~/pd/run.py profiler
- You can be warned about slowness by setting `slow_query`, `slow_page` and `slow_fetch` limits in conifg.json
