## Development Environment Setup

- Install MariaDB 10.0+ (alternative MySQL 8.0+)
- Install python3.6+
- Install pip3
- Install npm
- git clone <https://github.com/PennyDreadfulMTG/Penny-Dreadful-Tools.git>
- python3 dev.py build
- Add a bot at <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me>
- Add a bot user for the bot
- Add the bot to your server with `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your client id here>&scope=bot`
- Click to reveal the token (not secret) on <https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me>
- Copy config.json.example to config.json and alter the value for "token" to this value
- Optionally take a look at configuration.py and enter any required non-default information into config.json.
- Using the values from your config.json issue the following commands in MySQL (you don't need to create the databases):
  - CREATE USER '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>' IDENTIFIED BY '<mysql_password>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <decksite_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <prices_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <magic_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  - GRANT ALL ON <logsite_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
- Download a copy of the production decksite database (with personal information stripped):
  - mysql -u <mysql_user> -p<mysql_password> -e "CREATE DATABASE <decksite_database>"
  - curl <https://pennydreadfulmagic.com/static/dev-db.sql.gz> >/tmp/dev-db.sql.gz
  - gunzip /tmp/dev-db.sql.gz
  - mysql -u <mysql_user> -p<mysql_password> <decksite_database> </tmp/dev-db.sql
- Some very minor parts of the bot (the "modofail" command) use libopus and ffmpeg which are not in pip and must be installed in a your-OS-specific way separately. Very optional.
- You will want to investigate the various targets in dev.py that acts as a Makefile. Some of these utilities use GitHub's commandline git-enchancer, hub: <https://github.com/github/hub>
