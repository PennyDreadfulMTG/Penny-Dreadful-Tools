- Install python3.6+
  -- if you're running OSX, install python and openssl via brew.
- Install pip3
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt. If your default python is python2 try `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead.
- Add a bot at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
- Add a bot user for the bot
- Add the bot to your server with https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your client id here>&scope=bot
- Click to reveal the token (not secret) on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
- Copy config.json.example to config.json and alter the value for "token" to this value
- Optionally alter the various _dir and _database values in there if you want image files, scratch files and databases stored somewhere else. If you want to collect decks from tappedout.net with valid dates update to_username and to_password.
- Install MySQL.
- Using the values from your config.json issue the following commands in MySQL:
  -- CREATE USER '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>' IDENTIFIED BY '<mysql_password>';
  -- GRANT ALL ON <decksite_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  -- GRANT ALL ON <prices_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
  -- GRANT ALL ON <magic_database>.* TO '<mysql_user>'@'<mysql_host>';
- The sqlite extension we use for fuzzy matching is not part of any string distribution so you must download and build it.
  - curl https://sqlite.org/cgi/src/raw/ext/misc/spellfix.c?name=a4723b6aff748a417b5091b68a46443265c40f0d -o spellfix.c
  - curl https://sqlite.org/cgi/src/raw/src/sqlite3ext.h?name=8648034aa702469afb553231677306cc6492a1ae -o sqlite3ext.h
  - curl https://sqlite.org/cgi/src/raw/src/sqlite.h.in?name=2683a291ed8db5228024267be6421f0de507b80e -o sqlite3.h
  - gcc -fPIC -shared spellfix.c -o spellfix.dylib
    - Windows:   cl /LD spellfix.c
  - NOTE! You may need .dll or .so as the file extension instead of .dylib depending on your operating system.
  - If you don't want the spellfix library in the root of the app, copy the new spellfix.dylib file and change the location in config.json
  - You can delete the .c files once the compilation completes.
- To be able to load the spellfix1 extension we need load_extension which is not supported by the standard python sqlite3.
    - PLEASE NOTE: your system may have a python-apsw package which probably makes more sense than installing with pip. If you do need pip you can use the following command.
  - pip3 install --user https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw/releases/download/3.14.1-r1/apsw-3.14.1-r1.zip \
--global-option=fetch --global-option=--version --global-option=3.14.1 --global-option=--all \
--global-option=build --global-option=--enable-all-extensions
    Note: You may need `sudo -H` here and you may or may not need the `--user` option.
- Optionally add SELECT LOAD_EXTENSION('<path to spellfix.dylib>'); to your ~/.sqliterc

Notes on installing Python 3.6 in Linux Mint

These are the steps I needed to make to install Python 3.6 in a Linux Mint 17.1, where python 2.7 was the default:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3.6
  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | sudo python3.6 && sudo python3.6 -m easy_install pip

Note: this overwrites your existing pip and pip3 executables with the one from 3.6.

  sudo apt install python3.6-dev

The python3.6-dev I'm not sure it's actually required. 

  sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
  sudo apt-get install libatlas-dev
  sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran

  pip3 install -r requirements

Follow the above instructions for apsw. This installed the apsw in a .local in my home folder, and since I was doing everything with sudo, it had root permissions, which I had to fix:

  sudo chown -R user:user ~/.local/lib

The requests requirement might be an older version than the one needed (2.18.4), so if you need to upgrade:

  sudo pip3 install -U requests

I also had some problems with matplotlib and it's dynamic library link to numpy. It might have been cause I installed numpy or scipy by hand at some point, but if you get this kind of problem:

  RuntimeError: module compiled against API version 0xc but this version of numpy is 0xb

you can uninstall (or in my case just plain remove) matplotlib and reinstall it again with:

  sudo pip3 install matplotlib
