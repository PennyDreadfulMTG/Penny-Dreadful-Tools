        <h2>{{_ Other Rules}}</h2>
        <p>{{_ If a player starts a sideboarded game with less than 60 cards (quite possible due to a known Magic Online bug) and either player notices before the end of turn 2 and the player with a legal deck wants to restart the game, the game will be restarted. The result of any game played beyond turn 2 with less than 60 cards in maindeck will stand.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Matches should use 25 minute timers.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Matches must Allow Watchers so the PDBot can join them.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ A player may not play games under more than one account in a Penny Dreadful tournament.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Please do not double queue Penny Dreadful tournaments with other tournaments nor double queue in the league.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Spectating other matches is allowed â€“ do not write anything in chat except !record.}}
        <p>{{_ Only players completing the tournament will be awarded prizes.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Because of a [bug](https://github.com/PennyDreadfulMTG/modo-bugs/issues/308) removing all stops is not allowed.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ You may only enter a given tournament once (either on the same account or multiple accounts).}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Penny Dreadful tournaments follow official Magic Online tournament rules and do not allow draws, unlike some other player-run events.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ Dropping from the tournament in the elimination rounds will result in the forfeit of your next match.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ If a player realizes they have the wrong deck before the match begins they should take a screenshot of their opening hand as proof. Fix the deck and recreate the match. The player who had the wrong deck must give the choice of play or draw to their opponent.}}</p>
        <p>{{_ If a player (or PDBot) realizes they have the wrong deck mid-game they receive a game loss for that game. The match should be recreated with the right deck and games conceded to get the match into the right state.}}</p>
