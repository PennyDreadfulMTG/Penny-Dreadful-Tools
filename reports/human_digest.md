# Human digest

## Settled by bakert 2026-08-23 — digest cleared

- **#12710 — regex/brotli vs automating the fonts task.** CLOSED as completed.
  Resolved by events: the fix-12870 series put a font rebuild in the production deploy
  path, so the deps are genuinely needed. Re-verified against freshly fetched
  origin/master before closing.
- **#12670 — menu z-index stacking context.** Queued as a fix, with his constraint:
  restructure properly ONLY if low risk; the fixer must abort rather than force it, and
  must not fall back to merely documenting the levels. Held: will not dispatch until the
  Phase 2 go. Constraint stored at `evidence/12670.json#triage[1]` so it reaches the
  fixer prompt verbatim.
- **#12669 / #12671 / #12758.** Punted; out of scope for this campaign. They stay
  `deferred_human`, appear as report-only in the final report, get no GitHub action, and
  are not re-triaged.

Nothing is awaiting a decision from bakert.

## Noted, not actioned

- The deploy-time rebuild regenerates the symbols font but does not edit `pd.css`; the
  CSS half of #12710's 'fully automated' aside is still manual. The closing comment does
  not claim otherwise, so the closure stands. Raise a fresh issue if that matters.

## Awaiting bakert

- Phase 2 go, and which shape: everything, or triage + closures only (no new fix
  dispatches) to keep his review load flat.
- Whether to keep CI-repair fixers alive during the hold for PRs he is already reviewing.
